Hi,

In this repository I have included the following:
1. mysqlproject - contains the Visual studio solution and the program (main.cpp).
2. Logic_steps/docx - explains the transformation done on the data and the steps I performed.
3. sql_script.sql - consists of sql commands.
4. data_dump folder - consists of the dump file of the schema and data.
5. csv_files folder - consists of the 2 csv file (tranactions.csv and account_info.csv).

Please refer Logic_steps.docx file for the steps that needs to be followed for doing the transformation and to execute the program.

Thanks,
Nilesh
